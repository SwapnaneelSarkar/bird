# Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Favorites Navigation Issue
**Problem**: Navigating to Profile → Favorites → Explore Restaurants should redirect to the Home page for restaurants, but currently does not.

**Root Cause**: The "Explore Restaurants" button in the favorites page was using `Navigator.pop(context)` which just goes back to the previous page instead of navigating to the home page.

**Fix Applied**:
- Modified `lib/presentation/favorites/view.dart` line 372
- Changed from `Navigator.pop(context)` to `Navigator.of(context).pushNamedAndRemoveUntil(Routes.home, (route) => false)`
- Added proper import for `Routes` class
- This ensures that clicking "Explore Restaurants" properly navigates to the home page and clears the navigation stack

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/presentation/favorites/view.dart` - Fixed navigation logic and added Routes import

### 2. Address Saving Issue for New Users
**Problem**: While logging in with a new number, address functionality is not working and addresses are not being saved.

**Root Cause**: Timing issues where the address service is called before user authentication data (token and user ID) is properly saved to local storage, especially for new users.

**Fixes Applied**:

#### A. Enhanced Address Service with Retry Logic
- Modified `lib/service/address_service.dart`
- Added retry logic to both `saveAddress()` and `getAllAddresses()` methods
- Implemented up to 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff (500ms, 1000ms, 1500ms)
- Added detailed logging to track authentication state during retries
- Enhanced error messages for better debugging

#### B. Improved Authentication Data Saving
- Modified `lib/service/auth_service.dart`
- Added verification after saving user ID and token
- Added small delay (100ms) to ensure data is properly written to storage
- Enhanced logging to track data saving process

#### C. Enhanced Token Service
- Modified `lib/service/token_service.dart`
- Improved `saveAuthData()` method with verification after saving
- Added comprehensive logging to track all authentication data saving
- Better error handling and success verification

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/service/address_service.dart` - Added retry logic and better error handling
- `lib/service/auth_service.dart` - Enhanced data saving with verification
- `lib/service/token_service.dart` - Improved auth data saving with verification

## Testing

### Test File Created
- `test_address_fixes.dart` - Test file to verify address saving functionality for new users

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Favorites Navigation Test**:
   - Navigate to Profile → Favorites
   - Click "Explore Restaurants" button
   - Verify it navigates to Home page instead of going back

2. **New User Address Test**:
   - Login with a new phone number
   - Try to save an address
   - Verify address is saved successfully
   - Check logs for retry attempts and authentication verification

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Favorites Navigation
- Clicking "Explore Restaurants" in favorites page will navigate to the home page
- Navigation stack will be cleared, preventing back navigation to favorites

### Address Saving for New Users
- New users should be able to save addresses immediately after login
- Retry logic will handle timing issues automatically
- Better error messages will help identify any remaining issues
- Enhanced logging will provide detailed debugging information

## Debugging Information

The fixes include comprehensive logging that will help identify any remaining issues:

- **Address Service**: Logs retry attempts and authentication state
- **Auth Service**: Logs data saving verification
- **Token Service**: Logs complete auth data saving process

All logs are prefixed with service names for easy filtering and debugging.
