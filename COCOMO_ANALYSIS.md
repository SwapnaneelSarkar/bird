## 2. Revised COCOMO Model (Based on Actual Data)

### Corrected Cost Driver Analysis

#### Product Attributes
1. **Required Software Reliability (RELY)**: Nominal (1.00)
   - Food delivery app achieved required reliability
2. **Database Size (DATA)**: Nominal (1.00)
   - Database size was manageable for the team
3. **Product Complexity (CPLX)**: High (1.30)
   - Complex features were successfully implemented
4. **Required Reusability (RUSE)**: High (0.91)
   - Team effectively used Flutter components and patterns

#### Hardware Attributes
5. **Execution Time Constraint (TIME)**: Nominal (1.00)
   - Performance requirements were met
6. **Main Storage Constraint (STOR)**: Nominal (1.00)
   - Standard mobile storage requirements
7. **Platform Volatility (PVOL)**: Low (0.87)
   - Stable Flutter and mobile platforms

#### Personnel Attributes
8. **Analyst Capability (ACAP)**: High (0.85)
   - Team demonstrated strong analysis skills
9. **Applications Experience (AEXP)**: High (0.91)
   - Team showed good domain understanding
10. **Software Engineer Capability (PCAP)**: High (0.86)
    - Developers proved highly capable
11. **Platform Experience (PEXP)**: High (0.91)
    - Strong mobile development skills
12. **Language and Tool Experience (LTEX)**: High (0.91)
    - Proficient in Dart, Flutter, and related tools

#### Project Attributes
13. **Use of Software Tools (TOOL)**: High (0.86)
    - Effective use of development tools
14. **Multisite Development (SITE)**: High (0.93)
    - Remote team worked efficiently
15. **Required Development Schedule (SCED)**: Nominal (1.00)
    - Timeline was realistic and achievable

### Corrected Effort Calculation
**Effort Adjustment Factor (EAF) = Product of all cost drivers**
**EAF = 1.00 × 1.00 × 1.30 × 0.91 × 1.00 × 1.00 × 0.87 × 0.85 × 0.91 × 0.86 × 0.91 × 0.91 × 0.86 × 0.93 × 1.00 = 0.52**

**Corrected Effort = Basic Effort × EAF**
**Corrected Effort = 92.33 × 0.52 = 48.01 Person-Months**

### Why COCOMO Was Wrong Initially
1. **Overestimated Complexity**: Set CPLX to Very High (1.65) instead of High (1.30)
2. **Underestimated Team Capability**: Set all personnel factors to Low instead of High
3. **Overestimated Schedule Pressure**: Set SCED to Very High (1.23) instead of Nominal (1.00)
4. **Underestimated Tool Usage**: Set TOOL to Low (1.24) instead of High (0.86)

### What Made This Project Successful
1. **Highly Capable Team**: Despite being junior/mid-level, the team was very effective
2. **Good Tool Usage**: Effective use of Flutter and development tools
3. **Realistic Timeline**: 3-month deadline was achievable
4. **Efficient Remote Work**: Team worked well in distributed environment
5. **Strong Domain Understanding**: Team quickly grasped food delivery requirements
