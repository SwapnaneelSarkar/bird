# Email and Phone Verification Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds email and phone number verification functionality to the settings page. Both fields are now non-editable and include verification buttons that use Firebase OTP authentication for phone verification and a placeholder email verification system.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Non-Editable Fields
- Email and phone number fields in the settings page are now disabled (non-editable)
- Users cannot directly modify these fields
- Fields display the current values but prevent editing

### 2. Verification Buttons
- Each field has a "Verify" button next to it
- Button changes to "Verified" with green color after successful verification
- Visual feedback shows verification status

### 3. Firebase OTP Authentication
- Phone verification uses Firebase OTP authentication
- Sends OTP to the registered phone number with +91 country code
- Automatically formats phone numbers to include country code for Firebase
- Verifies OTP without saving user instance (verification only)
- Handles various error cases with user-friendly messages

### 4. Email Verification (Firebase OTP)
- Email verification uses Firebase OTP authentication
- Sends OTP to the user's registered phone number with +91 country code
- Uses the same Firebase OTP system as phone verification
- Automatically formats phone numbers to include country code for Firebase
- Verifies OTP without saving user instance (verification only)

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
1. `lib/service/verification_service.dart` - Service for handling verification logic
2. `lib/widgets/verification_dialog.dart` - Dialog widget for OTP input
3. `VERIFICATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files:
1. `lib/presentation/settings page/view.dart` - Updated to use verifiable fields

## Implementation Details

### Verification Service (`verification_service.dart`)
- Handles Firebase OTP sending and verification
- Includes error handling and user-friendly error messages
- Supports both phone and email verification using Firebase OTP
- Uses Firebase Auth for both phone and email verification
- Sends OTP to phone number for both verification types
- Automatically formats phone numbers with +91 country code for Firebase
- Signs out immediately after verification (no user persistence)

### Verification Dialog (`verification_dialog.dart`)
- Modal dialog for OTP input
- 6-digit OTP field with proper formatting
- Resend functionality with countdown timer
- Error display and success feedback
- Responsive design with proper animations

### Settings Page Updates
- Added `_buildVerifiableField()` method for non-editable fields with verification
- Added verification status tracking (`_isEmailVerified`, `_isPhoneVerified`)
- Added dialog methods for email and phone verification
- Updated field rendering to use new verifiable field component

## Usage

### For Phone Verification:
1. User clicks "Verify" button next to phone number
2. Firebase sends OTP to the registered phone number
3. User enters 6-digit OTP in the dialog
4. System verifies OTP and shows success message
5. Button changes to "Verified" with green color

### For Email Verification:
1. User clicks "Verify" button next to email
2. Firebase sends OTP to the user's registered phone number
3. User enters 6-digit OTP in the dialog
4. System verifies OTP and shows success message
5. Button changes to "Verified" with green color

## Error Handling

### Phone Verification Errors:
- Network errors
- Invalid phone number format
- Too many requests
- SMS quota exceeded
- Invalid OTP codes
- Session timeouts

### Email Verification Errors:
- Phone number not found in user profile
- Invalid OTP codes
- Session timeouts
- Network errors

## Future Enhancements

### Email Verification:
- The current implementation uses Firebase OTP sent to phone
- For true email verification, integrate with email service (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.)
- Send real verification codes via email instead of phone

### Additional Features:
- Verification status persistence
- Re-verification after certain time periods
- Multiple email/phone number support
- Verification history tracking

## Technical Notes

### Firebase Configuration:
- Uses existing Firebase Auth setup
- No additional Firebase configuration required
- Leverages existing OTP implementation from login flow
- Automatically formats phone numbers with +91 country code for Firebase compatibility

### Security:
- Verification is for display purposes only
- No user authentication state is saved
- Firebase user is signed out after verification
- OTP verification is stateless

### Performance:
- Minimal impact on app performance
- Efficient error handling
- Proper resource cleanup (timers, controllers)
- Responsive UI with animations
