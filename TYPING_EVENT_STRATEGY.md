# Typing Event Strategy for Blue Tick Updates

## Overview

This implementation uses typing events as a mechanism to trigger blue tick updates for both previous and new messages on an open chat page, rather than relying on actual user typing behavior.

## Core Logic

The system implements a **page-lifecycle and message-receipt-based typing system**:

1. **When chat page opens**: Emit `user_typing` event **immediately once** to update blue ticks for previous messages
2. **When new message is received AND chat page is currently open**: Emit `user_typing` event
3. **When chat page closes/user navigates away**: Emit `user_stop_typing` event

## Implementation Flow

```
Chat Page Opens → Emit "user_typing" (once) → Updates blue ticks for previous messages
↓
Wait for new messages...
↓
New Message Received + Page is Open → Emit "user_typing" → Updates blue ticks for new message
↓
Chat Page Closes → Emit "user_stop_typing"
```

## Key Components

### Events Added
- `ChatPageOpened`: Emitted when chat page is loaded
- `ChatPageClosed`: Emitted when chat page is closed/navigated away
- `MessageReceivedOnActivePage`: Emitted when new message arrives on active chat page

### Handler Methods
- `_onChatPageOpened()`: Emits typing event and marks previous messages as read
- `_onChatPageClosed()`: Emits stop typing event
- `_onMessageReceivedOnActivePage()`: Emits typing event and marks new message as read

### Page Lifecycle Management
- **initState()**: Sets up listeners and flags
- **dispose()**: Emits ChatPageClosed event
- **BlocConsumer listener**: Emits ChatPageOpened when chat is loaded
- **Back button**: Emits ChatPageClosed before navigation

## Benefits

1. **Reliable Blue Tick Updates**: Opening a chat immediately signals "I've seen previous messages"
2. **Real-time Updates**: Receiving new messages on open chat signals "I've seen this new message"
3. **No Dependency on Actual Typing**: Works regardless of whether user is actually typing
4. **Clean State Management**: Always emits stop_typing when leaving the page

## Logging

The implementation includes detailed logging with emojis for easy debugging:
- 🚀 CHAT PAGE OPENED
- 📨 MESSAGE RECEIVED ON ACTIVE PAGE  
- 📖 Marking messages as read
- 🚪 CHAT PAGE CLOSED
- ⚠️ Error conditions

## Usage

The strategy is automatically applied when:
1. User opens a chat page
2. New messages arrive while the chat page is active
3. User navigates away from the chat page

No additional configuration is required - the system handles all typing events automatically based on page lifecycle and message receipt.
